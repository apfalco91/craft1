			<h2><center>Screen Actors Guild Awards</center></h2>
			<p>The Screen Actors Guild Awards, which has only been around since 1995, is the award show for the American labor union that represents performers in television and film. Many claim it is an indicator for the Oscar's four major acting categories &#8211; Best Actor, Actress, Supporting Actor and Supporting Actress. The nominees are chosen by 2,100 members that are randomly selected. The winners are then picked by the 100,000-plus population of the organization, according to SAG.</p>

Currently, they have a format that includes two Best Picture, Actor and Actress winners &#8211; each for drama and comedy/musical. The winners are chosen by "about 90" members of the press organization, according to the HFPA.</p>

<p>Is it possible to predict Oscar winners? This question has plagued journalists, filmmakers, statisticians and more. But there are so many variables to worry about. Who could have honestly guessed that <i>Crash</i> would defeat <i>Brokeback Mountain</i> or <i>Shakespeare in Love</i> would overtake <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>?</p>

<div id = "wrapper1">
<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="toggle_visibility('SAG');"><img src="images/sag.jpg" alt="SAG, Academy-Awards" style="width:300px; height:200px;"></a>

<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="toggle_visibility('goldenglobes');"><img src="images/goldenglobes.jpg" alt="Golden-Globes, Academy-Awards" style="width:300px; height:200px;"></a>

<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="toggle_visibility('DGA');"><img src="images/dga.jpg" alt="DGA, Academy-Awards" style="width:300px; height:200px;"></a>
<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="toggle_visibility('PGA');"><img src="images/pga.jpg" alt="PGA, Academy-Awards" style="width:300px; height:200px;"></a></div>

<p> While accounting for these variables may be impossible or reserved for more talented statisticians, there is a way, at the least, to better understand these trends. Simply, let&#39;s look at the winners of the award shows prior to the Oscars: how many times have they correlated with the Academy Awards over the last 15 years?</p>

<p>Now, each picture displays one of the thirteen shows or critic choice awards that happen prior to the Oscars &#8211; the only one that is left out is the Gotham Awards, which was removed due to its smaller sample size. Each logo is clickable, leading to an explainer about the awards as well as showing the average, per year and per category, times each have chosen the same winner as the Academy.</p>

<div id = "wrapper2">
<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="toggle_visibility('NBR');"><img src="images/nationalboard.jpg" alt="National-Board-of-Review, Academy-Awards" style="width:300px; height:200px;"></a>

<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="toggle_visibility('ACE');"><img src="images/ACE.jpg" alt="ACE-Eddie-Awards, Academy-Awards" style="width:300px; height:200px;"></a>

<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="toggle_visibility('BAFTA');"><img src="images/bafta.jpg" alt="British-Academy-of-Film-and-Television-Arts, Academy-Awards" style="width:300px; height:200px;"></a>

<p>First and foremost, lets look at the award with the best overall average. Though the Directors Guild of America (DGA) has only one award that qualifies &#8211; Best Director &#8211; it has had the same winner as the Oscars in 12 of the last 15 years. In fact, if one were to go beyond the time parameters, then the DGA have had different winners only seven times, which is an astounding feat. If one looked at the Producers Guild of America (PGA), they have missed seven times in just the last 25 years.</p>

<p>Back to the parameters, the PGA ties the Critic's Choice as they both pick the Oscars&#39; Best Picture winner 73 percent of the time. Statistically, picking this landmark reward is the hardest, as it has the overall lowest average among all the categories: it sits at 40 percent, with the highest being best actor with 49 percent.</p>

<div id = "wrapper3">
<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="toggle_visibility('ISA');"><img src="images/independent.jpg" alt="Independent's-Spirit-Awards, Academy-Awards" style="width:300px; height:200px;"></a>

<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="toggle_visibility('CritChoice');"><img src="images/criticschoice.jpg" alt="Critic's-Choice-Awards, Academy-Awards" style="width:300px; height:200px;"></a>

<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="toggle_visibility('Sate');"><img src="images/satellite.jpg" alt="Satellite-Awards, Academy-Awards" style="width:300px; height:200px;"></a></div>

<p>As for the acting categories, one would expect the Screen Actors Guild &#8211; which is the go to example when trying to predict the Academy Awards&#39; acting winners &#8211; to have the highest percentage in those categories. While it still remains near the top of all four, it never out right wins one of them. The SAG ties the Golden Globes and Critics&#39; Choice for Best Actor. It comes in second to the Golden Globes with both actress and supporting actor. And ties British Academy for Film and Television Arts for supporting actress. Peoples&#39; use of SAG when it comes to an Oscar predictor might be due to the last three years, where they have never gotten more than one category wrong.</p>

<p>Finally, the shows with the overall worst percentage: the worst by far is the National Board of Review, which only got the same winner as the Oscars 19 percent of the time. Not very far behind are the National Society of Film Critics and the Independent Spirit Awards with 23 and 25 percent respectively. And it appears both Los Angeles and New York Critics&#39; picks truly are an alternative to the Oscars, as they round out the bottom five.</p>

<div id = "wrapper4">
<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="toggle_visibility('NYC');"><img src="images/nyfcc.jpg" alt="New-York-Film-Critics-Circle, Academy-Awards" style="width:300px; height:200px;"></a>

<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="toggle_visibility('LAC');"><img src="images/LAFCA.jpg" alt="Los-Angeles-Film-Critics-Association, Academy-Awards" style="width:300px; height:200px;"></a>

</div>

<p>In the end, even looking at these indicators, this does not provide the whole picture: meaning it is impossible to just use this information to guess this year&#39;s Oscar winners. However, if one were to take the highest percentage of each category, then the Best Picture would be either <i>The Big Short</i> or <i>Spotlight</i> &#8211; the latter is starting to gain steam.</p>

<p>The two acting would go to Leonardo DiCaprio and Brie Larson. The supporting actress is a toss up between Alicia Vikander and Kate Winslett, but actor will likely go to Stallone. Finally, Best Director is going to have a repeat winner with Alejandro Gonz&#225;lez I&#241;&#225;rritu. But we can only wait and see if these predictions have any merit.</p>
